        This circuit lets people know the temp and humidity of air around arduino. I decided to do this because the temperature and humidity in my room lately has been
        weird due to the cold and a draft.

        <p> Most of the firmware and the hardware placement is from Scott Campell at: <a href="https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-set-up-the-dht11-humidity-sensor-on-an-arduino/">circuit basics</a>.
            This was a link provided by the teaching staff on the slides. I already had come up with the idea but followed the link to see how to set up the sensor.
            I think saw Campell had already worked out what I was planning to do, so I followed his steps to make the process smoother.
            I changed the code up a bit and tried to comment thoroughly to make it more my own/prove I understood what was happening.
            I created the schematics based off of the circuit images, and followed them to make my circuit.</p>

        <h4>Why 220 ohms and a potentiometer for the LCD?</h4>
        <p>The 220 ohm resistor sets the background brightness for the display (the less resistence the brighter the background). I went with 220 ohm because I like that level of brightness and it is also a typical one used for this display according to the circut basics website.  </p>
        <p>The potentiometer is used to adjust the screen contrast. I like high contrast!</p>
