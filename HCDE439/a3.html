    <h1>Ilena's Assignment 3!</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <p>For this assignment I decided to make a circut that would give users information on the amount of light their plants were recieving. <br>
         For example an orchid needs 6-8 hours of filtered light a day. For the sake of the assignment requirements and time frame, I decided to use arbitrary numbers and ranges. I also made the time frame much shorter than 6-8 hours so it could hopefully be shown in the gif. <br>
         There is a red LED that shows current light intensity and three LEDs that show the total amount of light the "plant" has recieved.
         The blue LED is on when the plant hasn't recieved enough light, green turns on when the perfect amount of light has been recieved, and red turns on when too much light has been recieved.

        <p> Work for 220 Ohms for Red and Green: Values plugged into ohms law where I found you need at least 160 ohms of resistance, so I chose the next closest higher number (too high would create too weak a current) I have in resistors, 220. </p>

        <p> Work for 100 Ohms for Blue: Values plugged into ohms law where I found you need at least 80 ohms of resistance, so I chose the next closest higher number (too high would create too weak a current) I have in resistors, 100. </p>

        <h4>Why 10k ohms for photoresistor</h4>
        <p> 10k Ohms for the photoresistor helps us to use less power. The photoresistor would work with less but 10k is a nice convention. Without resistence, when the variable resistor is no resistance current would be essentially infinite. </p>

        <h2>Questions!</h2>
        <p>1. In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.</p>
        <img id="a3Q1" src="a3_stuff/a3_question1.jpg" />
        <p>2.Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage. Plot the voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.</p>
        <img id="a3Q2" src="a3_stuff/a3_question2.jpg" />    
        <p>3. AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer. </p>
