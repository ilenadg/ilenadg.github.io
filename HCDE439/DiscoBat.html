    <p>Disco Bat is the Ultimate Halloween party decoration!</p>

    <br>

      <h3>Context and Motivation</h3>
      <p>Bats and disco balls both hang from the ceiling, so a cross between the two would be the perfect halloween decoration. But this decoration could also have a utilitarian use. A good party (like one with a disco bat) has a lot of people having fun!  It can get hot, humid, and crazy. That's why disco bat can sense the room's temperature and humidity as well as how close someone is to the decoration. These numbers are displayed on a webpage where the host can see and decide if a window needs to be cracked for fresh air, or if people are getting too close to disco bat they can take it down. We wouldn’t want anyone to break disco bat would we.
        <br>
        In addition, I recently learned that bats look like they are raving when hanging upside down. Disco Bat seems even more appropriate after this new information. Take a look at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS6KWNB5NEo">Youtube Video</a>! I don't know who the original poster is, but a few clips are featured in my demo/music video for disco bat.

      <br>

      <h4>How It All Works</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
            Cardboard makes up the skeleton of the bat. Using fitted openings, the ultrasonic sensor and DHT sensor poke out of the face and butt of the bat respectively and are securely in place with jewelry wire and electrical tape. Wires run through the bat and out the back. Using the mini breadboard, the power for the two sensors are made parallel so that only one wire needs to run out of the bat to connect both to a power source. The same can be said for the ground. See a reference photo for the bats inner connections under “The Autopsy”.
            <br>
            The wires that need to connect to the arduino run out of the back of the bat and connect to the proper pins, power sources, and ground on the arduino. No extra resistors or connections were needed.
            <br>
            The stepper motor is connected to the stepper motor driver which connects the motor to the arduino’s power, ground, and 4 pins for the stepper motor’s operation. Resistors are built into the driver. The shaft of the stepper motor connects to the bottom of the bat and spins the bat back and forth 180 degrees when the arduino is on.
            <br>
            The arduino code has two main functions 1: to control the movement of the motor and 2: to collect sensor data to print them to the serial monitor. The code is dependant on the dht.h and stepper.h libraries to perform these tasks. The dht library allows for easy communication writing between the sensor and the arduino. Using a simple call, the arduino can retrieve the humidity and temperature readings with a singular pin and then print them to the serial monitor so they can later be displayed on a website using P5.js. The ultrasonic sensor is connected to two pins, one that triggers a high pitched frequency and one that waits to receive the time it took for that frequency’s echo to return. Once this time data is received a secondary function (from arduino example code) turns that time in microseconds into inches. This is how the bat determines the how far an object is from it. Like the humidity and temperature, the distance data is then printed to serial so that it can be displayed on the web.
            <br>
            The stepper motor moves in segments of 64 steps. Using a stepCount variable to keep track of how many steps have been taken, the the motor takes 64 steps every time the loop function runs and then the sensor data is collected. The motor moves until it gets to 180 degrees or 1024 steps and then it switches direction. I decided on it only taking a few steps at a time so that the sensor data can be as accurate as possible. If I had it step 180 degrees at once, the arduino would have to wait until the stepper motor was back where it began to take sensor readings.
            <br>
            In a separate environment I wrote files for a website so the host could see the environment data. This includes an index.html which structures the site and an index.js which deals with all of the interaction between the site, the arduino, and the arduino code. There are three functions from example class code that deal with the serial communication in index.js. They essentially allow the user to connect their arduino to the site so they can see the information. They also let the user disconnect and check for proper connection to the arduino via the port it is plugged into. For its main function draw, when something from the arduino code is serial printed, the code then displays it on the website. The js code has other smaller style functionalities like making a white canvas or styling the site.
